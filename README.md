#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering refers to the systematic and disciplined approach to designing, developing, testing, deploying and maintaining software applications.Its importance includes ensuring high quality softwares through testing and debugging,it also improves security and data protection by implementation of authentication and encryption to protect sensitive data.Software engineering also enhnces user experience as good software engineering practices ensure that applications are user friendly.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

The birth of software engineering (1968)- This milestone marked the beginning of systematic  approaches to software development emphasizing structured methodologies  documentation and quality assurance.
The Rise of structured programming (1970s) - This was characterized by removal of the spaghetti code that was unstructured and it was replaced by structured programming principles that improved software readability, maintainability and efficiency.Programming languages emerged promoting modular designs, loops and  and functions instead of direct jumps in code.
Emergence of agile methodologies - The agile  manifesto was introduced in 2001 in response to the rigidity of the waterfall methodology. This promoted collaboration  and iteractive teams allowing teams to respond quickly to changes.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

Planning phase- Here you highlight the goals of the software,set timelines, create a budget and then assign roles to the team members.
Design- This is the blue print stage. At this stage,you design how the software will look and work. You can make it visually appealing and user friendly.
Development- This is where the actual work takes place. At this stage, you begin to write down the code to bring your project to life.
Testing- This is the stage where you ensure your software works perfectly.
Deployment- At this stage, the project is launched into the real world.This means that the software is put live and users can start using it.
Maintenance - This is the post launch care i.e fixing any bugs, adding new features and keeping things up to date.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Waterfall methodology of software building  is like assembling a puzzle . One step has to be completed before you can proceed to the next step.This methodology applies best wherea project is well defined with stable requirements and miniml expected changes whereas Agile methodology focuses on small portions of work that are needed for the whole project. For this methodology, you can move to another task without necessarily having to complete the previous one.It is best suited for projects that require flxibility, continuous improvement and rapid delivery.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Responsibilities of a software developer

Software development and coding
Software design and architecture
Debugging and trouble shooting
Software testing and quality assurance
Software deployment and maintenance

Respnsibilities of a quality Engineer

Development and implementation of quality standards
Quality testing and inspection
Root cause analysis and defect resolution
Process improvement and optimization
Ensuring Compliance with the market standards

Rsponsibilities of a project manager

Providing leadership to the team
Ensuring effective communicationn through out the project development
Providing solutions to the team when needed.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

Integrated Development Environment is a tool that provides a comprehensive environment for writing,testing and debugging code. For example Visual studio code and phycharm.It helps in code writing and editing, helps identify and fix errors efficiently,allows compiling and running code directly within the environment and helps organize files dependencies and configurations in a structured way.
Version control systems tracks changes in code over time allowing developers to collaborate effectively i.e GIT.VCS allow developers to revert to previous versions incaes of errors or data loss,enables multiple developers to work on the same project hence team work,provides a structured way to review, comment and improve code quality and helps identify when and where bugs were introduced usisng commit history.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

Scope creeps - This is where the client may require you to keep adding extra features to the software. Here, you will need to stick to the plan and publicly say no when necessary.
Delays - This is where things take longer than expected. You will need to re adjust the schedule and prioritize what is important.
Team conflicts- This is where team members might disagree on some things along the way. To solve this, you will need to be a good listener and help mediate the problem.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

Unit Testing- Tests individual components or functions in isolation.It helps in early bug detection,improves code quality and facilittes debugging  and code documentation.
Integration Testing -Individual modules are combined and tested as a group to ensure they work together correctly. It helps detect interface issues, data flow problems and communicates errors between modules.
System testing- Tests the entire application as a whole to verify that it meets the specified requirements.It helps to identify defects before deployment and ensures compliance with the requirements.
User Acceptance testing- This is where real users validate whether the software meets business and user needs before it goes live.This helps to reduce risks of failure and enhance userr satisfaction.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompt engineering is the practice of designing  and refining inputs (prompts)to effectiveli interact with AI models. It involves crafting well structured queries to guide the AI in producing accurate, relevant and high quality responses.
Its importance includes: Enhancing AI response accuracy and relevance by eliminating vague, misleading or incorrect responses
Improves efficiency and productivity as users are able to get results faster
Bridges the gap between Humans and AI

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
"Tell me about history"

Improved prompt
"provide an overview of world war II including its causes, major events and consequences"
The improved prompt is more effective because it is more specific, has a clear scopeand prevents irrelevant details as the AI knows exactly what to include
